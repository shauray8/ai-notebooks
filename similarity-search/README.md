## compile a meaningful readme here 

###ToDo
gather the dataset from different websites (initially a few datapoints)
create an embeddings model (maybe miniLM or something)
store all the embeddings in a vector database and 
write a function that compares the embeddings with the prompt 

--- 
Do I have to train a model for embeddings or similarity search or maybe I can leverage the use of FAISS and get this done. 

20 - import minilm as the embeddings model, create embeddings 
21 - gather dataset and store it into json
22 - gather more data, make a website, compile all of it together, deploy on google cloud run
23 - make an youtube video, write readme, document and comment well


All of this can be done pretty easily with chatgpt actually ! Only thing I have to do is to compile all of it together and get all the parsing done which would take most of the time !
